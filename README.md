Black-Hole
==========

Provides a bunch of useful origin tools for placing origins in custom locations, as well as automating the process of repositioning object origins.

CURRENT FEATURES:
ORIGIN OPTIONS
- Set to Object Base (the lowest point on the local Z axis)
- Set to Lowest Point (the lowest point on the global Z axis)
- Set to Centre of Mass
- Set to Vertex Group (brings up another dropdown menu to let you select the group you want to use)
- Set to 3D Cursor

ORIGIN UPDATE BUTTON
- The small button next to the main dropdown lets you update the origin of all selected objects, based on their own origin preference

VERTEX GROUP SELECT
- A dropdown that appears when the vertex group option is selected, allowing the user to select what vertex group they want the origin point to snap to.


PLANNED FEATURES
- Set to Base Average - Will set the origin point to the lowest point of the model, based on a range of vertices in the Z axis, from the lowest vertex.
- Origin Options for Curves - The plugin will detect when a curve is being used, and will provide a set of entirely different object origin options that are relevant to curves.
